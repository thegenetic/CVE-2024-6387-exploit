# SSH Vulnerability Scanner

The SSH Vulnerability Scanner is a Python script that uses Nmap to scan a list of domains for vulnerable SSH versions. It checks multiple ports for SSH services and identifies versions that are known to have security vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Scans multiple domains from a file, one domain per line.
- Checks all ports for SSH service (comprehensive port scanning).
- Identifies and highlights vulnerable SSH versions.
- Uses threading for concurrent scanning to improve performance.
- Handles errors gracefully, including DNS resolution failures.
- Outputs results with colored formatting for clear visibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python `nmap` library (`python3-nmap`)
- Python `termcolor` library (`termcolor`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thegenetic/CVE-2024-6387-exploit.git
   cd CVE-2024-6387-exploit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a text file (`domains.txt`) containing domains to scan, with one domain per line.
2. Run the script with the file path as an argument:
   ```
   python CVE-2024-6387.py domains.txt
   ```

## Options

- The script uses Nmap with the following options:
  - `-Pn`: Treat all hosts as online (skip host discovery).
  - `-sV`: Probe open ports to determine service/version info.
  - `-p-`: Scan all 65535 ports.
  - `--script ssh2-enum-algos,ssh-auth-methods,ssh-hostkey,ssh-run,sshv1`: Use SSH specific scripts for more detailed information.

## Example Output

```
$ python CVE-2024-6387.py domains.txt

Scanning example.com (93.184.216.34)...
[example.com] SSH version detected on port 22: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.8p1

Scan Results:
